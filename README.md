# Heart-Disease-Prediction

**Introdction**

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally. This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in
patients using various machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which 
includes various medical attributes.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is the UCI Heart Disease dataset. It contains 14 attributes such as age, sex, 
chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, 
maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and more.


**Goal**

A major challenge facing HealthCare Organizations is the provision of quality services at afordable costs.
Poor clinical decisions can lead to disastrous consequences which are therefore unacceptable.
Hospitals minimize the cost of clinical tests.
